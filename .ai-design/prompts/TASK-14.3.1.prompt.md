## Objective
Implement "TASK-14.3.1: Add action-type metadata and policy checks for finance tools".
Story: US-14.3 - Action-type policy enforcement and approval-aware execution

## Constraints
- Only touch files in this repository/workspace.
- Avoid broad refactors; keep changes focused on this task.
- Preserve existing behavior unless required by acceptance criteria.
- Keep naming and code style consistent with surrounding code.

## Implementation Plan Checklist
- [ ] Inspect current code paths and identify exact files to edit.
- [ ] Implement the smallest viable change for this task.
- [ ] Verify the implementation against acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each finance tool is classified as read, recommend, or execute in registry metadata.
- Policy evaluation enforces action-type restrictions before any finance tool handler is invoked.
- Execute-type finance actions above the configured approval threshold create an approval request instead of performing a state change.
- Approval requests store a reference to the originating task and tool execution record.
- Rejected approval requests leave the underlying finance state unchanged and mark the tool execution as rejected.
- Automated tests cover allowed read execution, denied execute execution, approval-required execution, approved execution, and rejected execution.

## Validation Commands
- dotnet build

## Files To Touch (Guessed)
- docs/postgresql-migrations-archive/README.md

## Definition Of Done
- Acceptance criteria above are satisfied.
- Code changes are complete and consistent with the repository style.
- Prompt consumer returns:
  - List of touched files
  - Brief summary of what changed and why

## Output Requirements
- Report exactly which files were modified.
- Provide a concise change summary.
- Mention any follow-up risks or TODOs.
