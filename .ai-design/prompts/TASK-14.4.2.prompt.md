## Objective
Implement "TASK-14.4.2: Implement a mock finance provider adapter for all finance tool operations".
Story: US-14.4 - Replaceable mock provider adapter boundary for finance tools

## Constraints
- Only touch files in this repository/workspace.
- Avoid broad refactors; keep changes focused on this task.
- Preserve existing behavior unless required by acceptance criteria.
- Keep naming and code style consistent with surrounding code.

## Implementation Plan Checklist
- [ ] Inspect current code paths and identify exact files to edit.
- [ ] Implement the smallest viable change for this task.
- [ ] Verify the implementation against acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The orchestration layer accesses finance capabilities only through a finance tool provider interface.
- No orchestration component imports or calls internal finance domain services directly for tool-backed operations.
- A mock finance provider adapter implements all registered finance tool operations and returns schema-compliant responses.
- Provider selection is configurable so the mock adapter can be replaced by a future real external adapter without changing tool contracts.
- Static analysis or architecture tests fail when orchestration code introduces direct dependencies on finance domain services.

## Validation Commands
- dotnet build

## Files To Touch (Guessed)
- docs/postgresql-migrations-archive/README.md

## Definition Of Done
- Acceptance criteria above are satisfied.
- Code changes are complete and consistent with the repository style.
- Prompt consumer returns:
  - List of touched files
  - Brief summary of what changed and why

## Output Requirements
- Report exactly which files were modified.
- Provide a concise change summary.
- Mention any follow-up risks or TODOs.
