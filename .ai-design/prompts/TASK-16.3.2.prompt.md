## Objective
Implement "TASK-16.3.2: Implement data evolution rules for periodic invoices, bills, transactions, and recurring expenses".
Story: US-16.3 - ST-F403 — Implement time progression and data evolution engine

## Constraints
- Only touch files in this repository/workspace.
- Avoid broad refactors; keep changes focused on this task.
- Preserve existing behavior unless required by acceptance criteria.
- Keep naming and code style consistent with surrounding code.

## Implementation Plan Checklist
- [ ] Inspect current code paths and identify exact files to edit.
- [ ] Implement the smallest viable change for this task.
- [ ] Verify the implementation against acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A time progression service advances simulated company time in configurable increments from 1 hour to 7 days.
- Advancing simulated time generates new transactions, invoices, bills, and recurring expense instances according to configured business rules.
- Generated records use timestamps derived from simulated time rather than wall-clock time.
- The engine supports accelerated execution for tests, allowing 30 simulated days to be processed in under 60 seconds in non-production mode.
- Each progression step writes an execution log containing company ID, simulated time range, generated record counts, and emitted event counts.

## Validation Commands
- dotnet build

## Files To Touch (Guessed)
- docs/postgresql-migrations-archive/README.md

## Definition Of Done
- Acceptance criteria above are satisfied.
- Code changes are complete and consistent with the repository style.
- Prompt consumer returns:
  - List of touched files
  - Brief summary of what changed and why

## Output Requirements
- Report exactly which files were modified.
- Provide a concise change summary.
- Mention any follow-up risks or TODOs.
